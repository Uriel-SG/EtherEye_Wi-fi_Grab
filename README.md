***üîí A powerful and simple hacking script (cmd and powershell) for Windows network assessment, designed to test network configuration resilience and user security awareness.***

# üéØ Features
- Automated extraction of stored Wi-Fi credentials on Windows systems
- Data exfiltration via Discord webhook 
- Stealth mode with automatic log cleanup
- Attiny85 compatibility for physical attack simulations

# Execution Vectors
## Shell Injection Modes

- Direct shell execution on target Windows system (only one line)
- Delivery via .bat or .exe file formats
- (Bad) USB vector (Attiny85) using the .ino file

## The .ino file

If the ethereye.ino file doesn‚Äôt work for any reason, I‚Äôve created a PowerShell script (*ethereye.ps1*) that performs the same function as the .bat file and can be executed directly by **ATtiny85** ‚ö°. The reference code is in ***ethereye2.ino***.

üîß Make sure to correctly enter your **webhook address** in the PowerShell file and the **link to your script** in the Bad USB ino file üíª.
